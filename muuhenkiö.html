        <p>Pedro Pascal
</p>
<p>In Narcos, Pedro Pascal starred as Javier Peña, a complex and morally gray DEA agent hunting Pablo Escobar and later other cartels, appearing in all three seasons and becoming a fan-favorite for his nuanced portrayal of a flawed, dedicated operative navigating the dangerous drug trade in Colombia. His departure after Season 3 was initially planned for the series' shift to Mexico but also followed safety concerns after a crew member's tragic death, emphasizing a commitment to cast and crew well-being. </p>
